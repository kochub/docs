# Storage types


{{ mgp-name }} lets you use network and local storage drives for database clusters. Network storage drives are based on network blocks, which are virtual disks in the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure. Local disks are physically located on the cluster servers.

In a {{ mgp-name }} cluster, the type of storage for master hosts and segment hosts may differ.

## Specifics of local SSD storage {#local-storage-features}

Local SSDs do not provide fault-tolerant storage and impact the cost of the entire cluster: a cluster with this type of storage is charged even if it is not running. Read more in the [pricing policy](../pricing).
